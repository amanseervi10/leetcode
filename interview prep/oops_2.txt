OOPS : 

# Keyword : Static

# In java static local variables are not allowed
In Java, a static variable is a class variable (for whole class). 
So if we have static local variable (a variable with scope limited to function),
it violates the purpose of static. Hence compiler does not allow static local variable.

# Keyword : const

Value of a const cannot be changed. It needs to be initialized at the time of declaration.
In java const Keyword is not there

const appearing after the parentheses in a member function
declaration specifies that the function will not change any data
in the calling object

a->b is equivalent to (*a).b


# Keyword : Super
If super( ) is not used, then the default or parameterless constructor of
each superclass will be executed.

# Keyword : this
The this keyword is used to refer to the current object in a method or constructor.

# Keyword : final
The final keyword in java is used to restrict the user.
The java final keyword can be used in many context. Final can be:
variable - final variable value can't be changed
method - final method can't be overridden by subclasses
class - final class can't be inherited





Inheritance - helps to reuse the code and establish a relationship between different classes

Polymorphism - When you have and interface but can have multiple implementations.
Polymorphism refers to the process by which some code, data, method, or object behaves differently
under different circumstances or contexts


Encapsulation  - Wrapping up of data and methods into a single unit is Encapsulation (e.g. Class)

Abstraction - hiding the implementation details from the user, only the functionality will be provided to the user. 
                abstract class and interface
