It it's a team, it's alright, otherwise I tend to be a bit disorganized.
So these days i have started to make notes and keep a track of things i need to do.

Also I used to speak really fast, and quite often someone who has not interacted with with me before
would not be clearly make out what i am trying to say.
So i have started to speak a bit slowly and clearly.

#Questions to ask back

How is the work culture at your company?

what kind of work does an intern do?

If you were my age, why would you want to intern at salesforce.
What are the things that an intern can learn at salesforce.

If you have worked in other companies, how is the work culture different from them.


#Why i would want to intern there

I recently had a conversation with my seniors who interned at salesforce this summer, and 
they said that it was great, the work envirnoment was great, and then mentors were supportive.

Besides salesforce is industry leader in what it does so why not to work with some of the best minds.
